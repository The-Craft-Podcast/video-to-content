# Notes for the transcript processor
- Remove the filler words like "um", "uh", etc.
- Clean up the sentences, but do not change what they've said. We need this to match the audio perfectly.
- "Track 1" is the interviewer, Michail Katkoff. Just refer to him as Michail.
- Maxim's company is called Playrix -- it's frequently misunderstood in the transcript as "Play Works", "Play ricks" etc. Please fix these mentions.
- Use the timestamps embedded in the transcript to estimate the time slice of chapter cuts. The timestamps are in the format [hh:mm:ss].


# Proper format
Michail: [00:00:00] Ipsum lorem dolor sit amet.
Maxim: [00:00:12] Consectetur adipiscing elit.
Michail: [00:00:20] Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Maxim: [00:00:30] Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
